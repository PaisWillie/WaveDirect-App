# WaveDirect App

A Flutter mobile application made in less than 48 hours! (My first full app, too!)

Submission for BorderHacks 2020 hackathon; WaveDirect Award.


**Challenge Description**

Design a mobile application, that allows for quick and easy access to widgets that enable our end-users to manage their account, without an overly complicated user experience.

**My reponse**

One of the biggest challenges that the average person faces is the ability to navigate difficult graphical user interfaces, specifically on a web browser. With the WaveDirect app, anyone can easily use it without any obstacles!

**Tools used:**
- VS Code
- Flutter UI Toolkit by Google
- Android Studio & Emulator

**Dependencies:**
  
- [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- [fab_circular_menu](https://pub.dev/packages/fab_circular_menu)
- [image_picker](https://pub.dev/packages/image_picker)
- [google_maps_flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/google_maps_flutter)
- [simple_animations](https://pub.dev/packages/simple_animations)

**Outage Map**

Internet down? Clients can check the status of their local ISP's wireless access point, simply by looking at the top left of their map, and know exactly when those access points go live again, so they can continue browsing the internet.
